# Logarithmic Score

The Log score is defined as

$$\text{LS}(F, y) = - \log f(y)$$,

where $f$ is the density function associated with $F$. The Log score is only defined for
forecasts that have a density function. This means the Log score cannot be calculated
when evaluating discrete forecast distributions, such as ensemble forecasts.
